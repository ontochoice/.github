# Welcome to the OntoChoice GitHub repository
Welcome to the **Collaborative Ontology Selection and Recommendation Resources Development** repository! üöÄ

This project aims to **collaboratively develop a reference** for selecting terms and ontologies, encouraging systematic development and promoting reusability within the community. üåê

## What are we all about?
We aim to collect a reasonably comprehensive list of metrics and indicators of the value of a term or ontology, including the following:
* characterizing the fitness for specific purposes of those metrics and indicators;
* discussion of possible sources of the needed data for those metrics;
* reflection on how the metrics can be adjusted (either in weighting, or in content) for particular use cases; and
* examples of how the metrics might be, or are, collected, presented, and discovered.

Here is a list of categories, and partial list of criteria, for evaluation.
Each of these categories has multiple specific criteria that could be used to evaluate it. 
Some of the categories and criteria are fairly objective, while others are more subjective.
Similarly, some criteria can be automated, while others require human evaluation.

**Popularity**: includes reuse, visits, selections from a search list, and other voting techniques

**Reuse of ontologies / terms**: in either case, reuse considers the ontology as a whole, ontology fragments, design patterns, profiles, and individual terms

**Governance**: methods and controls for modification and change tracking; trust indicators; change frequency and recency

**Community Relevance**: (typicall referring to domain communities) includes adoption, standardization, concept applicability 

**Internationalization**: how widely used, 'level' of governing body, international re-use, use of multiple languages in text annotations 

**Matching**: precision, and if multiple terms, match frequency and specialization 

**Quality**: by metrics, by independent assessment(s) 

**Analytics**: includes ontology structure, 'shape, and other measurable statistics

**Best Practices Adoption**: includes documented recommendations on ontology/term creation, and FAIRness recommendations!
