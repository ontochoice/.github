# Welcome to the OntoChoice GitHub repository
Welcome to the **Collaborative Ontology Selection and Recommendation System Development** repository! üöÄ

This project aims to **collaboratively develop a model** for selecting terms and ontologies, ensuring systematic development and promoting reusability within the community. üåê

## What are we all about?
We aim to collect a reasonably comprehensive list of metrics and indicators of the value of a term or ontology, including characterizing the fitness for specific purposes of those metrics and indicators. Discuss possible sources of the needed data for those metrics. Reflect how the metrics can be adjusted (either in weighting, or in content) for particular use cases. Provide examples of how the metrics might be, or are, collected, presented, and discovered.

Here are our current list of criteria for evaluation:
Each of these categories has multiple specific criteria (many objective, some subjective or harder to measure) that could be used to evaluate it: **Popularity** (including reuse, visits, selections from a search list, other voting techniques); 
**Reuse of ontologies / terms** (in either case, reuse considers the ontology as a whole, ontology fragments, design patterns, profiles, and individual terms); 
**Governance** (methods and controls for modification and change tracking; trust indicators; change frequency and recency);
**Community** (as in, domain) relevance (adoption, standardization, concept applicability); 
**Internationalization** (how widely used, 'level' of governing body, international re-use, use of multiple languages in text annotations); 
**Matching** (precision, and if multiple terms, match frequency and specialization); 
**Quality** (by metrics, by independent assessment(s)); 
**Analytics** (ontology structure); 
**Best Practices Adoption** (documented recommendations on ontology/term creation; includes FAIRness recommendations)!
