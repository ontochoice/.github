# Welcome to the OntoChoice GitHub repository
Welcome to the **Collaborative Ontology Selection and Recommendation System Development** repository! üöÄ

This project aims to **collaboratively develop a model** for selecting terms and ontologies, ensuring systematic development and promoting reusability within the community. üåê

## A short introduction
We aim to collect a reasonably comprehensive list of metrics and indicators of the value of a term or ontology, including characterizing the fitness for specific purposes of those metrics and indicators. Discuss possible sources of the needed data for those metrics. Reflect how the metrics can be adjusted (either in weighting, or in content) for particular use cases. Provide examples of how the metrics might be, or are, collected, presented, and discovered.
